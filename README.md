# Flight Departure Data Analysis (Python)

This project analyses CSV-based flight departure data from major European airports.
It was originally developed as **university coursework** and is presented here as a
personal portfolio project.

## Features
- User input validation (airport codes, year, airline codes)
- CSV file handling and data analysis
- Flight statistics (delays, distances, temperatures, destinations)
- Data visualisation using histogram graphics
- Results saved to a text file for record keeping

## Technologies Used
- Python
- CSV data processing
- Dictionaries, lists, loops, and functions
- `graphics.py` (Zelle) for visualisation

## Requirements
This project uses **Zelle’s graphics.py** library.
You must install it for the histogram to display correctly.

## Example Output
- Terminal usage statistics
- Airline departure percentages
- Histogram of flights per hour

## Notes
This project demonstrates core Python programming and data analysis skills.
It has been cleaned and refactored beyond coursework requirements for portfolio use.
